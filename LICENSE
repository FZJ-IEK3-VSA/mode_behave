It is not allowed to use this model for business-related purposes at all.
The model shall only be used for scientific purposes.
All projects, which relate to the use of this model have to be reported to
and acknwledged by the BMVI, as the model is based upon non-open source data. 
The underlying data-packages are derived from the mobility survey 
"Mobilit√§t in Deutschland 2017". Several data-packages have been provided by
the BMVI (MiD17-B1, -B2, -B3), which are used in DIFFERENT parts of the model
and which are EXPLICITLY NOT COMBINED. Thus, the combined use of these model 
parts is prohibited as well, although no retrieval of the source-data would
be possible.
