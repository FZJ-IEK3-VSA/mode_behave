Model Purpose and General Information
=====================================
MO|DE.behave is a Python-based software package for the estimation and 
simulation of discrete choice models. The purpose of this software is to enable 
the rapid quantitative analysis of survey data on choice behavior, 
utilizing advanced discrete choice methods. 
Therefore, MO|DE.behave incorporates estimation routines for conventional 
multinomial logit models, as well as for mixed logit models with nonparametric 
distributions.
Furthermore, MO|DE.behave contains a set of post-processing tools for visualizing 
estimation and simulation results. Additionally, pre-estimated 
discrete choice simulation methods for transportation research are included to 
enrich the software package for this specific community.

On mixed logit models:
In recent years, a new modeling approach in the field of discrete choice theory 
became popular – the mixed logit model (see Train, K. (2009): "Mixed logit", 
in Discrete choice methods with simulation (pp. 76–93), Cambridge University Press). 
Conventional discrete choice models only have a limited capability to describe 
the heterogeneity of choice preferences within a base population, i.e., 
the divergent choice behavior of different individuals or consumer groups can 
only be studied to a limited degree. Mixed logit models overcome this deficiency and 
allow for the analysis of preference distributions across base populations.
